# Operations (M0, §19)

Source-run local web app. No installers/packages, no remote access/auth,
no external telemetry, no app-managed rolling log files.

## Source run

Requirements: Node.js `24.12.0`, pnpm `11.25.0` (see `engines` +
`packageManager`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm start            # serve on loopback only (127.0.0.1 / localhost)
```

Manual backup (stopped-server only, no listener/scheduler started):

```sh
pnpm --filter @companion/server backup
```

Takes exactly `backup` with no arguments or path flags. The DB path comes
only from `COMPANION_DB_PATH` (or the OS default) and the backup dir is
always `<data>/backups`. Prints only the backup file basename on success;
a missing DB fails without creating any DB or backup files.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPANION_DB_PATH` | OS app-data `companion-harness/companion.sqlite` | Absolute or resolved; symlinks rejected fail-closed |
| `COMPANION_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback only (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`) |
| `COMPANION_PORT` | `3000` | `0` = ephemeral (tests only) |
| `COMPANION_TIME_ZONE` | `UTC` | IANA name only (Intl membership) |
| `COMPANION_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |
| `COMPANION_MARKDOWN_ROOTS_JSON` | `[]` | Strict JSON array of `{ path, alias? }` (see below); unset means no Markdown connector |
| `COMPANION_MODEL_JSON` | unset (no model) | Strict JSON object `{ adapter, baseUrl, model, apiKey? }` (see M2 below); unset registers no model strategy |

Config is Zod-validated and frozen at startup (no hot reload).

## Plaintext sensitivity and OS permissions

The DB and backups are stored **in plaintext** (no app-level encryption).
Protection relies on **OS file permissions**; credentials/secrets are never
stored in the DB.

- POSIX: app dir and `backups/` are `0700`; DB and backup files are `0600`.
  A POSIX app-dir `chmod` failure aborts startup fail-closed (fixed safe
  error, no path logged).
- Windows: there is **no chmod security guarantee**. Rely on the
  current-user profile ACL (per-user `%APPDATA%`); do not assume `chmod`
  restricts access.

Logs carry fixed codes plus scalar ids/sizes/durations only (stdout/stderr).
No message text, tool/model I/O, file paths, or secrets. Startup/shutdown
`status` values are a fixed vocabulary (`unknown` fallback); arbitrary
reason/error names never enter logs. The DB path is never logged.

## Capacity warning

DB + WAL combined size above exactly **1 GiB** emits a startup warning log
(`server.store_size_warning` with `bytes` only). Warning only: no vacuum,
no delete, no auto-shrink.

## Manual backup (stopped-server only)

- Sole copy method: better-sqlite3 `Database.backup`. Never `VACUUM INTO`
  or online raw file copy.
- Path: `<data>/backups/companion-manual-<UTC>-<uuid>.sqlite`
  (`<UTC>` = `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`).
- Procedure: `.partial` backup → private permissions (`0600`; Windows
  no-op) → `quick_check` of the copy → atomic rename.
- Manual backups are **never rotated** and never match the
  `companion-pre-migration-` prefix. The only automatic deletion is the
  newest-3 pre-migration rotation.
- Exposed only as the stopped-server CLI command above. **No HTTP
  backup/restore/delete endpoints exist.** The CLI takes no path flags,
  uses only the configured DB path, prints only the backup basename, and
  reports failures with fixed safe text only (no paths, no raw errors).

## Manual restore (stopped-only, exact sequence)

1. Stop the server.
2. Preserve the current db / wal / shm files (copy aside, do not delete yet).
3. Copy the selected verified backup to a temp target next to the
   configured DB.
4. Run `PRAGMA quick_check` against the temp copy; abort on failure.
5. Atomic rename the temp copy onto the configured DB path.
6. Only while still stopped, remove stale `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars.
7. Start the server (startup will migrate as needed).

There is no automatic restore/rollback.

## Full-store deletion (stopped-only)

1. Stop the server.
2. Delete the configured db file, its `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars, and the
   `backups/` contents under the app-data directory.
3. Start only when a fresh store is intended.

There is **no session-level delete/export API** (no per-session physical
deletion, no user export). Domain data is otherwise never auto-deleted
(RunEvent/Snapshot/Reference/Receipt kept indefinitely).

## Markdown references (M1, read-only)

Unset `COMPANION_MARKDOWN_ROOTS_JSON` (default `[]`) means no Markdown
connector and no reference tools (M0 behaviour). When set, exactly one
connector instance owns **all** configured roots.

### Root configuration format

- Exact format: a strict JSON array of objects with only `{ path, alias? }`.
  Example (POSIX): `[{"path":"/srv/notes","alias":"notes"}]`. Example
  (Windows generic): `[{"path":"C:/Notes","alias":"notes"}]`. Quoting for
  the JSON env value is shell-dependent; pass one JSON document as a single
  env value.
- `path`: non-empty absolute path, max 4096 chars, no NUL byte.
- `alias` (optional): `1-64` chars matching
  `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}$/`; duplicates rejected. Max 1024 roots.
- Unknown keys, scalars, objects, non-absolute paths, and malformed JSON are
  rejected fail-closed at startup with a fixed safe message (no paths
  logged). The parsed roots are deep-frozen (no hot reload).

### Fingerprint-bound connector (startup gate)

- The connector identity fingerprint (derived from the resolved roots) is
  persisted on the single connector instance row with the expected root
  count. Changing roots, count, order, or aliases afterwards **fails
  startup** (fixed `connector config fingerprint mismatch`-family error).
- There is **no automatic rebinding**. Operators must either revert the
  config to the previously accepted roots, or intentionally start from a
  fresh store (see full-store deletion above) when a new root set is wanted.

### Read-only bounds, safety, and skips

- Markdown files are **never written**. There is no HTML rendering, no
  semantic/fuzzy search, and no FTS: search is whole-query literal
  substring only, under NFC normalization plus locale-independent
  per-code-point case folding.
- Exact bounds: **10000** files per vault (exceeding fails the whole
  search), **1 MiB** per file (raw or NFC-normalized UTF-8 bytes),
  query **1-256** code points, results **default 10 / max 20**, snippet max
  **512** code points (first body hit, deterministic order: title exact,
  then title substring, then body, canonical-key tie-break).
- Oversize files are never truncated: they become explicit `skipped`
  entries. Invalid UTF-8 is a fatal `invalid_utf8` skip (never replacement
  text). Bodies are stored as saved full normalized (NFC) Snapshot text.
- Safety: reads verify realpath containment inside the configured roots
  before and after reading; external symlinks are rejected, internal
  aliases fold to one canonical resource; reads use resolve+stat,
  no-follow open where available, fstat identity comparison, and post-read
  recheck.

### Expanded link graph budget (M1, agreed)

- One `markdown.search` / `reference.refresh` call may persist at most
  **256KiB** of normalized link graph metadata. There is **no per-link
  count cap**.
- Over budget, the whole call fails with **`output_too_large`**: no
  truncation, no partial writes. `reference.open` / `reference.related`
  never expand the graph. Exact accounting is defined in the
  implementation plan (§14.6).

### Stored-only reference HTTP API

- `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/references` (saved reference list).
- `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/references/:referenceId` (saved detail;
  returns the stored full normalized body, never rereads the external file).
- `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/reference-sets/:setId` (saved set detail).
- `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/reference-context` and
  `PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/reference-context` (frozen context
  summary; optimistic version check).
- There is **no HTTP search/open/refresh/related**: those paths return
  validation/unknown-route errors. Reads create no events or grants.

### Internal-only ToolBroker tools

- Exact tool names: `markdown.search`, `reference.open` (stored-only),
  `reference.refresh` (only reread path; always a new Snapshot + rN),
  `reference.related` (saved link graph only). They are callable only from
  inside a running Run via ToolBroker (ownership/budget/audit); there is no
  direct POST endpoint for them.

### M2 local model (strict opt-in)

- Unset `COMPANION_MODEL_JSON` (default) registers **no model strategy**:
  runs fail closed with a fixed code instead of producing fake LLM output.
- When set, the value must be a strict JSON object with only
  `{ adapter, baseUrl, model, apiKey? }`. Example:
  `{"adapter":"ollama","baseUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:11434","model":"llama3.1"}`.
  `adapter` is `ollama` (POST `{base}/api/chat`) or `openai-compatible`
  (POST `{base}/v1/chat/completions`, or `{base}/chat/completions` when the
  base already ends in `/v1`). `baseUrl` must be plain `http` on a loopback
  host (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`) with no credentials, query, or
  fragment (normalized form is stored). `model` is `1-256` chars;
  `apiKey`, when present, is a non-empty string up to `4096` chars.
  Unknown keys, scalars, arrays, and malformed JSON are rejected
  fail-closed at startup with a fixed safe message (no URLs, names, or
  key material logged).
- The server builds the gateway from the frozen config and registers the
  M2 agent strategy under `m0-default` **before** engine recovery/start
  and listen. The agent reuses the M1 ToolBroker when Markdown roots are
  configured, otherwise a private empty-registration broker (no direct
  model endpoint is ever added; `answer.submit` stays a reserved
  non-broker terminal protocol).
- Security limitations: model config values and keys are **never logged**
  (only the tool count is logged); `model_calls` persists adapter/model
  identifier metadata only (adapter, model, outcome, error code, timing,
  usage token counts). `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, prompts, raw responses,
  reasoning, and secrets are never persisted or logged; single attempt per
  step (no retry, no fallback, no router, no redirects); per-step 120s
  and 300s whole-run wall budgets with at most one repair inside max 8
  steps; native tool calling only.

### MCP library wire identity (C09; not server-enabled)

- The connector's trusted config must carry an explicit `expectedServerName`
  and `version`. Both are compared **exactly** (case-sensitive) against the
  ACTUAL `initialize.serverInfo` `name`/`version` of the bound MCP server.
  There is no default and no inference from `serverId` (a logical id) or the
  actual response; a programmatic config that omits either fails closed.
- The wire gate runs on **every real transport, before any `tools/list` and
  before any binding is enabled**. A missing/mismatched identity disables ALL
  configured bindings, closes the half-open child, and reports the existing
  fixed `mcp_schema_mismatch` (no raw identity is surfaced). A malformed SDK
  initialize that the SDK connect rejects or cannot parse stays the existing
  fixed `mcp_unavailable`; a post-connect mismatched wire identity stays the
  fixed `mcp_schema_mismatch`.
- Only after the wire gate passes are `tools/list` pages followed (bounded)
  and each binding verified by exact upstream tool name + canonical
  input-schema SHA-256. Correct wire identity with one drifted tool is
  partial drift: the matching tool stays callable, the drifted tool stays
  denied with the same fixed `mcp_schema_mismatch`.
- `isAllowed`/`stats().enabledBindings` advertise **only** bindings validated
  on the current live connection; configured-but-drifted names stay lazy and
  never trigger an upstream call. Shutdown or a failed logical call clears
  them.
- NOT added here: readonly-binding registration, upstream fork pinning,
  OAuth, or server enablement. The formal status stays **HOLD**; other C09
  lifecycle checks and the C10/C11 gates remain open. The CURRENT constructor
  additionally requires the reviewed host `McpBindingDefinition[]` second
  argument (see "C09-01 / C09-04 / C09-07 / C09-08" below): the
  `new McpConnector(cfg)` calls in the PR15/PR16 archives are the HISTORICAL
  API, not a compatibility shim, and this phase still registers nothing.

Config fragment (trusted fields only; **not** a production command, profile,
or complete activate config):

```json
{
  "kind": "mcp",
  "serverId": "<logical id; never compared to the wire name>",
  "expectedServerName": "<exact initialize.serverInfo.name>",
  "version": "<exact initialize.serverInfo.version>",
  "bindings": [
    { "upstreamTool": "<exact tool name>", "canonicalSchemaHash": "<64 hex>" }
  ]
}
```

### C09-02 / C09-03 demand lifecycle verification status

- This subsection records **only** C09-02 (lazy-on-demand connect + exact
  backoff) and C09-03 (per-instance concurrency / no automatic resend /
  independent instances); it is not a global "only these are verified" claim.
- Lazy: the first configured demand dials immediately; construction and idle
  time never create a transport. A valid live client/handshake is reused across
  later demands (no new factory call).
- Failure backoff follows exactly `1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 30s` (max `30s`); a
  successful connect resets the failure counter, so the next loss waits `1s`
  again.
- A failed in-flight logical call is never automatically resent. A distinct
  new/queued call may dial a fresh connection after the reset backoff.
- Per instance the connector serializes demand with true concurrency `1`
  (FIFO queue); separate instances share no global mutex and stay independent.
- CI-compatible regression coverage (committed regression,
  `packages/connector-mcp/test/connection-lifecycle.test.ts`, 5 cases): the
  REAL `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `Client` + `McpServer` linked by
  `InMemoryTransport` under a deterministic fake clock
  (`setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`/`Date` only) — a framework-level contract test.
- Local non-CI proof additionally ran the same connector over a genuine SDK
  **stdio fixture** process (actual spawn / spawn-ENOENT, same-PID reuse,
  handler drop / FIFO gate). This is a fixture smoke only — it is **not**
  evidence of the upstream fork, OAuth, or live Google compatibility.
- Existing wire-gate / `serverId`-vs-`expectedServerName`+`version` semantics
  are unchanged. The formal status stays **HOLD**; the remaining unverified
  C09 gates and the C10/C11 gates stay open, and no Calendar-adoption decision
  is made here (C09-02/03 and C09-05/06 scope are separated below).
- Graph-budget CI coverage note (same PR run): the real-vault
  `packages/connector-markdown/test/graph_budget_integration.test.ts` (5 cases)
  previously reported a **Windows CI** timeout at **6099ms** on the
  ambiguous-link case, whose large same-basename fixture was the cost. It now
  drives the REAL connector over a bounded **16-directory / 18-real-`.md`-file**
  temp vault whose wide canonical candidate keys retain the 256KiB cap proof
  (160 repeats ≈317653 bytes reject `output_too_large`; a 2-link control
  ≈3969 bytes stays under cap) without the large filesystem setup. This is
  **local proof only** (target file 5/5, root `tsc`, scoped Biome clean); it
  does not raise the timeout, skip the case, or change the production budget.

### C09-05 / C09-06 transport bounds & shutdown status

- This subsection records **only** the local, owned-branch verification of
  C09-05 (stdio stderr-bounded termination) and C09-06 (bounded shutdown /
  kill timeout), plus the loopback-HTTP cleanup path.
- Real STDIO local non-test smoke (actual Node 24 + real SDK 1.30.0 real
  `StdioServerTransport` children): **8/8 green**. Latest archived real-stdio
  stdout: S7 stubborn shutdown **111.528ms** with a real `onclose`, owned PID
  gone, exactly one actual production SIGKILL; S8 cooperative **3.918ms** /
  no kill; actual `finalOwnedPidsAlive=[]`.
- Real loopback HTTP local non-test smoke (actual Node 24 + real SDK
  `McpServer` + `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, historical PR16 API
  `new McpConnector(cfg)` default HTTP transport — NOT the current
  constructor and NOT a compatibility shim): **7/7 green** — positive
  `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`; pending-RPC shutdown with a
  preserved prior `onclose`; 3xx refusal for 301/302/303/307/308/304 with zero
  destination hits; post-connect `tools/call` 307 refusal with no resend;
  direct-fetch refusal for every input form; streaming-body cancel; and the
  schema-bypass no-network tripwire (actual fetch count `0`).
- Deterministic controlled-SDK unit coverage: **26 cases** (9
  transport-bounds / stderr-cap, 12 shutdown-race, 5 HTTP redirect-cleanup)
  inside the full **1123 tests / 92 files**; root + e2e typecheck clean;
  Biome 190 files with 0 warnings (one pre-existing recommended-rule info).
- Bounds: stdio stderr is COUNT-ONLY per connection, saturating at 64KiB;
  byte 65537 aborts open/call/idle into fixed `mcp_unavailable`, synchronous
  state clear, and bounded cleanup. `shutdownWaitMs` stays `100..10000`
  (default `3000`) as the GRACE window, plus a fixed additional **2000ms**
  force-close wait; the real owned positive public-SDK PID is captured before
  `close()` clears the getter, and the exit proof is an actual close event,
  not `close()` promise resolution. Generic/HTTP settle waits are HOST-bounded
  and do NOT prove external process death; a numeric PID public API cannot
  guarantee a durable OS identity or process tree.
- Fixture/local evidence only: NOT upstream-fork / OAuth / auth,
  ordinary-CLI, or live-Google proof. Commands and counts are typed observed
  values, not future CI or head-SHA claims. The formal status for the
  remaining C09/C10/C11 gates and Calendar adoption stays **HOLD**.
- Retained archives live OUT-OF-REPO under
  `/home/molmot/.local/share/opencode/tool-output/c09-transport-verify/`:
  `after-http/` (`harness.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `stdout.json`, `result.json`,
  `records-result.json`, `commands.txt`, `fail-history.txt`) and the
  `after-stdio/` archive; the earlier `before/` archive is unchanged. The
  in-repo `.c09-proof/http-final` helper and its compiled output were
  TEMPORARY and deleted after publication, so it is NOT a retained archive.
  The prior root 54 env-load-failure full run (with the stale idle-trigger and
  SDK fixture-typing failures) is preserved under `final-checks/`; the final
  full pass, which followed the OWNED workspace-resolved dependency borrow,
  is under `final-checks-with-deps/`.

### C09-01 / C09-04 / C09-07 / C09-08 trusted read policy, model exposure & real stdio

- This subsection records the CURRENT new-scope observed work: C09-07 trusted
  read-only binding policy, C09-01 / C09-04 model-visible tool exposure, and
  C09-08 the production DEFAULT stdio transport. It supersedes the remaining
  "unverified" C09 naming as the current scope, but the historical PR15/PR16
  counts and the earlier wire/transport subsections above remain historical
  evidence and are NOT restated as this run. It is not a global live-Google /
  Windows / production-registration claim, and no package pin changed
  (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0`, `zod@4.5.4`, provider pins unchanged).
- CURRENT constructor is `new McpConnector(config, readonly
  McpBindingDefinition[], factory?)`: the trusted `McpBindingDefinition[]`
  (readonly `upstreamTool` / `canonicalSchemaHash` / `category`) is the
  REQUIRED second argument; `factory` stays the optional third. `category`
  reuses the contracts `ToolCategory` vocabulary (`read` / `write` /
  `sensitive` / `unclassified`). This is an internal, breaking-library API
  change; the `new McpConnector(cfg)` calls in the PR15/PR16 HTTP/stdio
  archives are the HISTORICAL API (recorded as such), not a compatibility shim.
- Real in-memory SDK BEFORE → AFTER policy (`before-policy/` and
  `after-policy/` under the out-of-repo `c09-security-verify/`): BEFORE, an
  unclassified fake writer with a neutral-looking `search` name was callable
  and produced a provider effect (`providerEffects=1`), and the model surface
  exposed non-read descriptors. AFTER, trusted `write` / `sensitive` /
  `unclassified` definitions and missing definitions deny `callTool` AND
  `ensureConnected` with fixed `mcp_binding_not_allowed`, `dials=0`,
  `handlerCalls=0`, `providerEffects=0`, `enabledBindings=[]`; the model
  advertisement of four KNOWN descriptors yields only `markdown.search` plus
  the reserved `answer.submit` LAST. A caller-claimed `category:"read"` /
  `readOnlyHint:true` cannot upgrade any class.
- Valid READ-positive: the ORIGINAL `after-policy` read positive is
  SUPERSEDED (its fixture incremented a writer counter; `providerEffects=1`)
  and MUST NOT be cited as a read proof; its supersession note
  (`SUPERSEDED-read-positive.txt`) is retained and the original artifacts are
  unchanged. The corrected, source-distinct immutable-read proof is
  `after-policy/corrected-read-positive/result.json`: `delete-event`
  (`readOnlyHint:false`), config/trust/wire hash linked, `ensureConnected` /
  `callTool` ok, `handlerCalls=1`, `providerEffects=0`, connector shut down
  (`connectedAfterShutdown=false`), fixture server closed. The negative and
  model halves of the original `after-policy` proof remain valid and were NOT
  re-run here.
- Real production DEFAULT stdio (Linux, Node 24.12, SDK 1.30.0 child) in
  `after-stdio/{result,summary,commands}`: the allowed canary is present and
  the excluded canary is ABSENT; the literal six injection-shaped args produce
  no shell marker and no model marker; model-supplied command/args/env travel
  only in the RPC payload (fixed transport), with the actual 2 calls sharing
  one child PID. A missing live-SDK default env name yields fixed
  `mcp_unavailable` with no START record and zero spawns. A direct real-SDK
  ENOENT on the owned path is rejected with the path/canary present, while the
  production connector returns the fixed redacted result with failure count 1.
  Cleanup observed `ownedPidsObserved=2` / `finalOwnedPidsAlive=[]` via the
  owned startup PID + `process.kill(pid, 0)` after shutdown. NO public
  `onclose` claim, NO Windows physical proof, NO fork / OAuth / live Google /
  production registration.
- Default SDK env: EVERY effectively inherited SDK default name must be
  explicitly allowlisted even when unset; there is no extra function-value
  policy or filter. `shell=false` is the SDK pin behavior plus an actual
  metacharacter proof. The PR16 transport bounds and actual `onclose` semantics
  are unchanged.
- Before/after actual-SDK archives (all under the out-of-repo
  `c09-security-verify/`; source + commands + failure history retained there,
  in-repo temporaries removed and not retained in the repo): `ambiguity`
  (6 malformed host variants in both orders permitted before, denied locally
  with zero I/O after; live conflict denied both orders `N` with 0 calls while
  the unrelated `M` read actually succeeds and is the only enabled name),
  `catalog` (before, an unfinished prefix authorized `N` with 1 call; after,
  all bindings disabled, `mcp_schema_mismatch`, `listCount=10`, 0 calls;
  complete tenth page actually succeeds; complete-catalog partial drift
  preserved), and `catalog-shutdown` (before, shutdown during the real
  final-page digest wrongly returned `mcp_schema_mismatch`; after,
  `mcp_unavailable` with `enabled=[]` and 0 calls). These are actual
  observations, not inflated case counts or upstream-compatibility claims.
- Latest local full-battery result (OBSERVED, after this patch set; recorded under
  the out-of-repo `c09-security-verify/final-checks/`): root `pnpm run
  typecheck` exit 0, `pnpm run typecheck:e2e` exit 0, `pnpm test` **94 files /
  1137 passed / 0 skipped** (Linux), and whole-repo `pnpm run lint`
  (`biome check .`) **192 files, 0 errors / 0 warnings / 1 pre-existing info**
  (the `biome.json` `recommended` deprecation is not a new warning). The first
  lint run counted the temporary in-repo `.security-proof/` helpers (216 files,
  33 errors / 60 warnings) which are NOT product code; they were archived
  out-of-repo and removed from the repo, and the affected lint was re-run. This
  is a local, owned-branch observation and not a future CI or head-SHA claim.
  The historical PR16 baseline (1123 tests / 92 files) is NOT used to predict it.

## Non-goals (explicit)
Domain retention/GC (except newest-3 backup rotation), user export,
session delete API, running-process deletion, auto-restore, DB/backup
encryption, external telemetry, app-managed log files, installers,
remote access/auth.

## Platform / TOCTOU limitations

- better-sqlite3 opens by path with no portable no-follow open; a symlink
  swap in the narrow open→recheck window cannot be fully eliminated. The
  bootstrap narrows it with pre-open lstat guards plus an immediate
  post-open recheck (fail closed).
- Backup prune re-verifies containment + non-symlink immediately before
  delete (best-effort TOCTOU narrowing).
- POSIX permission bits are not meaningful on Windows (see above).
